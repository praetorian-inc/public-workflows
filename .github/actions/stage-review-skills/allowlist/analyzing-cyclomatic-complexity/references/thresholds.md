# Cyclomatic Complexity - Industry Thresholds

## McCabe's Original Recommendation (1976)

Thomas J. McCabe, who developed the metric, recommended:

> **Maximum cyclomatic complexity: 10**

**Rationale:**

- Based on empirical studies of software reliability
- Functions with complexity >10 showed significantly higher defect rates
- Corresponds to the limit of human short-term memory (7±2 items)

**McCabe's guidance:**

- "Programmers should count the complexity of the modules they are developing and split them into smaller modules whenever the cyclomatic complexity exceeds 10."

## NIST Guidelines (NIST 500-235)

**NIST Special Publication 500-235: "Structured Testing"**

> "A cyclomatic complexity of 10 is a good starting point."

**Extended guidance:**

- **Basic rule**: Use 10 as the default threshold
- **Experienced teams**: May use up to 15 for projects with:
  - Experienced staff
  - Formal design processes
  - Modern programming languages
  - Structured programming practices
  - Comprehensive code walkthroughs
  - Complete test plans

**NIST warning:**

> "Limits over 10 should be reserved for projects that have several operational advantages over typical projects."

## Microsoft Visual Studio Thresholds

**Visual Studio Code Metrics:**

| Threshold | Color  | Meaning                                 |
| --------- | ------ | --------------------------------------- |
| 1-10      | Green  | Low complexity, maintainable            |
| 11-20     | Yellow | Moderate complexity, review recommended |
| 21-25     | Orange | High complexity, refactor recommended   |
| 26+       | Red    | Very high complexity, warning issued    |

**Microsoft's official documentation:**

- **Warning threshold**: 25
- **Recommendation**: Keep below 25 to avoid warnings
- **Best practice**: Aim for 10 or below

## NASA Software Assurance Technology Center (SATC)

**Key finding:**

> "The most effective evaluation is a combination of size and cyclomatic complexity. The modules with both high complexity AND large size tend to have the lowest reliability."

**Combined metrics approach:**

| Complexity | Lines of Code | Risk Level | Action                |
| ---------- | ------------- | ---------- | --------------------- |
| ≤10        | Any           | Low        | Acceptable            |
| 11-15      | <100          | Moderate   | Review                |
| 11-15      | 100-200       | High       | Refactor recommended  |
| 16-25      | Any           | High       | Refactor              |
| >25        | Any           | Critical   | Immediate refactoring |

**NASA recommendation**: Don't evaluate complexity in isolation - always consider code size.

## SonarQube Thresholds

**Default configuration:**

```yaml
complexity:
  function: 10
  file: 10
  class: 80
```

**Severity levels:**

- **Info**: 10-15
- **Minor**: 16-20
- **Major**: 21-25
- **Critical**: 26+

**SonarQube also tracks:**

- **Cognitive Complexity** (complementary metric)
- **Nesting depth** (structural complexity)
- **Lines of code** (size)

## Industry Research (2024)

### LinearB Research

**Finding**: Cyclomatic complexity alone is insufficient.

> "Code with low cyclomatic complexity can still be difficult to maintain. A function might have few decision points yet suffer from unclear variable naming, poor documentation, inconsistent abstractions, or convoluted logic."

**Recommendation**: Use **Cognitive Complexity** alongside cyclomatic complexity.

### DX (DevEx) Research

**Study of 100+ engineering teams:**

| Threshold | Team Adoption | Outcomes                                   |
| --------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| 10        | 45%           | Most successful at reducing defects        |
| 15        | 35%           | Balanced between strictness and pragmatism |
| 20        | 15%           | Struggled with technical debt              |
| 25+       | 5%            | High defect rates, maintenance issues      |

**Key insight**: Teams enforcing threshold of 10 had:

- 40% fewer bugs in complex modules
- 25% faster code review cycles
- Higher developer satisfaction (less cognitive load)

## Language-Specific Thresholds

### Go (Golang)

**gocyclo default**: 10 (strict)

**Justification:**

- Go emphasizes simplicity
- Explicit error handling increases complexity naturally
- Early returns and guard clauses are idiomatic

**Adjustment for Go:**

```bash
# Strict (default)
gocyclo -over 10 .

# Moderate (for established projects)
gocyclo -over 15 .
```

### JavaScript/TypeScript

**ESLint default**: 20 (lenient)

**Recommendation**: Lower to 10 for better maintainability

**Configuration:**

```javascript
// .eslintrc.js
rules: {
  'complexity': ['error', 10]  // Stricter than default
}
```

**Rationale**: JavaScript's flexibility can lead to overly complex functions. Stricter threshold encourages functional decomposition.

### Python

**radon default**: No threshold (report only)

**Common thresholds:**

- **A**: 1-5 (simple blocks)
- **B**: 6-10 (well-structured)
- **C**: 11-20 (moderate complexity)
- **D**: 21-50 (high complexity, refactor)
- **F**: 51+ (unstable, critical refactoring)

**Flake8 configuration:**

```ini
# setup.cfg
[flake8]
max-complexity = 10
```

## Domain-Specific Adjustments

### Financial/Tax Software

**Threshold**: 15-20 (higher tolerance)

**Rationale:**

- Regulatory requirements create inherent complexity
- Business rules are externally imposed
- Correctness > simplicity

**Mitigation:**

- Comprehensive test coverage (>90%)
- Extensive documentation
- Regular audits

### Validation Logic

**Threshold**: 12-15 (moderate tolerance)

**Rationale:**

- Input validation requires many checks
- Sequential validations are acceptable
- Alternative (strategy pattern) may be over-engineering

**Example:**

```typescript
function validateUser(user: User): ValidationResult {
  if (!user.email) return { valid: false, error: "Email required" };
  if (!isValidEmail(user.email)) return { valid: false, error: "Invalid email" };
  if (!user.age) return { valid: false, error: "Age required" };
  if (user.age < 18) return { valid: false, error: "Must be 18+" };
  // ... 8 more validations
  return { valid: true };
}
// Complexity: 12 (acceptable for validation)
```

### State Machines

**Threshold**: 20+ (high tolerance if well-structured)

**Rationale:**

- State machines have many transitions by design
- Explicit switch statement clearer than pattern abstractions
- Complexity is essential, not accidental

**Requirements:**

- Clear state diagram documentation
- Comprehensive state transition tests
- No nested state logic

## Chariot Platform Recommendations

Based on our codebase analysis:

### Backend (Go)

| Component    | Threshold | Justification                                  |
| ------------ | --------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Handlers     | 10        | User-facing, frequent changes                  |
| Services     | 12        | Business logic, moderate complexity            |
| Repositories | 8         | Data access, should be simple                  |
| Validators   | 15        | Input validation, sequential checks acceptable |

### Frontend (React/TypeScript)

| Component  | Threshold | Justification                             |
| ---------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Components | 8         | UI logic should be simple                 |
| Hooks      | 10        | State management, moderate complexity     |
| Utils      | 10        | Pure functions, easy to test              |
| Forms      | 12        | Validation logic, more complex acceptable |

### CI/CD Configuration

Recommended `.lizard.yml`:

```yaml
thresholds:
  default: 10

  # Stricter for critical paths
  src/handlers/auth: 8
  src/repositories: 8

  # Moderate for validation
  src/validators: 12

  # Tolerant for state machines
  src/state-machines: 15

# Warning (non-blocking)
warnings:
  complexity: 10

# Error (block PR)
errors:
  complexity: 25
```

## Setting Your Threshold: Decision Matrix

| Factor                    | Threshold 10        | Threshold 15       | Threshold 20+        |
| ------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------- |
| **Team experience**       | Junior              | Mixed              | Senior               |
| **Code change frequency** | High                | Moderate           | Low                  |
| **Test coverage**         | <80%                | 80-90%             | >90%                 |
| **Domain complexity**     | Simple CRUD         | Business logic     | Financial/regulatory |
| **Bug tolerance**         | Low (prod-critical) | Moderate           | Higher               |
| **Review rigor**          | Automated only      | Automated + manual | Comprehensive manual |

**Formula:**

```
Recommended threshold = 10 + adjustments
  + 2 if team is senior
  + 2 if test coverage >90%
  + 3 if domain is inherently complex (finance, regulations)
  - 2 if code changes frequently
  - 2 if bug tolerance is low
```

## Evolutionary Approach

**Don't enforce strict thresholds immediately** on legacy code:

### Phase 1: Measurement (Month 1)

- Run tools without blocking
- Identify complexity distribution
- Find hotspots (complexity + churn)

### Phase 2: Soft Warnings (Month 2-3)

- Warn at 20 (generous)
- Educate team on refactoring
- Review high-complexity PRs manually

### Phase 3: Moderate Enforcement (Month 4-6)

- Warn at 15
- Block at 25
- Allow exceptions with justification

### Phase 4: Strict Enforcement (Month 7+)

- Warn at 10
- Block at 15
- Exceptions require architectural review
