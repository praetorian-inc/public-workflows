# Discovering Reusable Code

**Force exhaustive codebase discovery to prevent the #1 implementation failure: creating new code when reusable code exists.**

## The Problem This Solves

Without discovery, developers and agents default to special-casing:

```go
// What happens without discovery
func handleRequest(req Request) {
    if req.IsNewFeature {  // ← Special-case #1
        doNewThing()
    }
    if req.HasNewFilter {  // ← Special-case #2
        applyNewFilter()
    }
    // Original code unchanged but surrounded by conditionals
}
```

**Real failure**: A feature added `if newFeature` branches to 8 functions instead of extending the existing handler chain. Why? The developer didn't know the handler chain existed.

**Root cause**: Can't reuse what you don't know about.

## Core Principle

> **"Prove you looked everywhere before creating anything new."**

## When to Use This Skill

**Use before:**

- Implementing new features in existing codebases
- Modifying core business logic
- Making design decisions that could extend existing patterns
- Analyzing what can be reused for a proposed feature

**Skip for:**

- Pure greenfield projects with no existing patterns

**🚨 MANDATORY: Maintain a numbered task list and track progress before starting the discovery process.** The 5-step methodology involves multiple searches and analysis phases. Without external tracking, steps get skipped under time pressure.

## Quick Reference

| Step                       | What                             | Output                                 |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| 1. Requirements extraction | Identify needed functionality    | List of components/patterns            |
| 2. Exhaustive search       | Run grep/find across modules     | Files discovered with functionality    |
| 3. Reusability assessment  | Apply 100%/80%/60%/40%/0% matrix | Categorized implementations            |
| 4. 10-file rule            | Justify any new file creation    | Minimum 10 files analyzed              |
| 5. Discovery report        | Document findings                | Structured report with recommendations |

## Step 1: Requirements Extraction

From the feature description, extract:

- Functional components needed
- Data models involved
- API patterns required
- UI components needed
- Business logic requirements

## Step 2: Exhaustive Search Methodology

**YOU MUST document the actual commands run, not just claim "searched the codebase."**

**Path convention:** the commands below use placeholders — substitute your repo's layout. `[repo]` = the repository root; `[module]` = a module/package/service subtree (a monorepo might glob `modules/*/`; a single-app repo might use `.` or `src/`). The subpaths shown (`backend/pkg/handler`, `ui/src/hooks`, …) illustrate a layered Go + React layout; map them to your own stack's directories.

### Functionality Keyword Search

```bash
# Backend/Go patterns
grep -r "[functionality_keyword]" [module]/backend/pkg/ --include="*.go" -l

# Frontend/TypeScript patterns
grep -r "[ui_keyword]" [module]/ui/src/ --include="*.tsx" -l
grep -r "[ui_keyword]" [module]/ui/src/ --include="*.ts" -l

# Python CLI/Lambda
grep -r "[cli_keyword]" [module]/backend/lambdas/ --include="*.py" -l
```

### Pattern-Based Searches

```bash
# Go patterns
grep -r "type.*Handler" [module]/backend/pkg/handler/ -l
grep -r "interface.*Service" [module]/backend/pkg/service/ -l
grep -r "interface.*Repository" [module]/backend/pkg/repository/ -l
grep -r "func.*Repository" [module]/backend/pkg/repository/ -l

# Frontend patterns
grep -r "export.*use" [module]/ui/src/hooks/ -l
grep -r "const.*Component" [module]/ui/src/ -l
grep -r "export.*function" [module]/ui/src/components/ -l
```

### File Name Searches

```bash
# Find by entity name
find [repo]/ -name "*[entity_name]*" -type f

# Find by feature area
find [repo]/ -name "*[feature]*" -type f
```

### Documentation Searches

```bash
# Architecture and design docs (-exec ... {} + handles spaces and skips cleanly on no matches)
find [repo]/ -path "*/docs/*" -name "*.md" -exec grep -l "[concept]" {} +
find [repo]/ -name "CLAUDE.md" -exec grep -l "[pattern]" {} +
```

### Coverage Verification

After searching, document:

- Number of files searched per module/subtree
- Total files matching search criteria
- Subtrees covered (each `[module]` the search glob expanded to)

## Step 3: Reusability Assessment Matrix

For EVERY relevant existing implementation discovered, assess:

| Reuse Level | Criteria                    | Action                              |
| ----------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **100%**    | Can be used exactly as-is   | Import and use                      |
| **80%**     | Needs minor extension       | Add method/prop to existing         |
| **60%**     | Needs adaptation            | Refactor to accept new case         |
| **40%**     | Significant refactor needed | Evaluate if worth it                |
| **0%**      | Cannot be reused            | **REQUIRES 10+ FILE JUSTIFICATION** |

### Assessment Criteria

| Level | Example                                                        |
| ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 100%  | Handler implements interface, just register it                 |
| 80%   | Hook exists, add optional parameter for new use case           |
| 60%   | Similar service exists, extract shared logic to base class     |
| 40%   | Pattern exists but tightly coupled, needs significant refactor |
| 0%    | No similar implementation exists anywhere                      |

## Step 4: The 10-File Rule

Before proposing ANY new file, you must:

1. Analyze minimum 10 existing files for reuse potential
2. Document why each cannot be extended
3. Provide specific technical justification

**Example justification** (worked against Praetorian's Guard/Chariot monorepo — the `modules/chariot/...` paths are illustrative; substitute your own):

```markdown
### Proposed: modules/chariot/backend/pkg/handler/asset/filter.go

#### Files Analyzed for Reuse (10 minimum):

1. `modules/chariot/backend/pkg/handler/asset/handler.go`
   - Cannot extend because: Handler pattern doesn't support dynamic filtering

2. `modules/chariot/backend/pkg/handler/risk/handler.go`
   - Cannot adapt because: Risk-specific logic tightly coupled

3. `modules/chariot/backend/pkg/query/builder.go`
   - Cannot extend because: Query builder is for graph queries, not list filtering

[... continue to minimum 10 files ...]

#### Technical Justification:

- Existing handlers use static endpoint registration
- New requirement needs dynamic filter composition
- No existing abstraction handles parameterized list filtering
```

This prevents the "I looked and didn't find anything" shortcut.

## Step 5: Discovery Report Format

Your output MUST include the structure below. The filled-in values in the template — the `modules/chariot/...` paths and stack-specific references like TanStack Query — are a worked Guard/Chariot example to show the level of detail expected; replace them with your codebase's real paths and stack.

## KEY FINDINGS

- **Reuse Percentage:** [X]%
- **Files to Extend:** [N]
- **Files to Create:** [M]
- **Critical Constraints:** [Any discovered constraints]
````

## Validation Criteria

A compliant discovery report must have:

- ✅ COMPLIANCE CONFIRMATION statement present
- ✅ Search methodology documented with actual commands
- ✅ Minimum 5 existing implementations analyzed
- ✅ 10+ files analyzed for any "create new" proposals
- ✅ Reuse percentage calculated
- ✅ Pattern inventory with extension points
- ✅ Integration recommendations

## Anti-Patterns to Detect

Flag these in your report:

| Anti-Pattern                 | What to Look For                               |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Special-casing**           | `if newFeature { }` scattered across functions |
| **Parallel implementations** | Similar functions with minor variations        |
| **Copy-modify patterns**     | Duplicated code with tweaks                    |
| **Scattered conditionals**   | Same feature check in multiple locations       |

## Scaling Discovery

This skill is orchestration-agnostic. It can be:

1. **Invoked standalone** - someone asks "what can we reuse for X?"
2. **Run very thorough** - dedicate a full exhaustive pass before architecture
3. **Part of a workflow** - discovery phase before architecture
4. **Ad-hoc analysis** - any time a reuse question arises

For large codebases, partition the search space by module or feature area. If your harness can spawn parallel subagents, dispatch one per module to run the search methodology concurrently and merge their discovery reports; otherwise process each module inline and sequentially, preserving the same per-module coverage. The output format (Discovery Report) is consumable by any caller.

## Related Techniques

Pair this with evidence-based analysis to verify specific APIs exist before relying on them, and treat DRY adherence as the underlying motivation — exhaustive discovery is how you find the code worth reusing instead of duplicating. The Discovery Report it produces feeds directly into implementation planning.

## Remember

The 5 minutes spent on exhaustive search prevents 5 hours of technical debt from special-casing. If you shortcut the search, developers will create duplicate code because they won't know what exists.
