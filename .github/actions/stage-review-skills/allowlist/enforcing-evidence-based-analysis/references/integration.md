### When Each Applies

| Phase             | Skill                             | Verifies                          | Example                                                  |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Research/Planning | enforcing-evidence-based-analysis | Read source files, quote APIs     | "useWizard returns nested objects (verified at line 72)" |
| Implementation    | (none)                            | Write code based on verified plan | Implement the plan                                       |
| Completion        | verifying-before-completion       | Run tests, check output           | "Tests pass: 34/34 (verified)"                           |

### They Don't Overlap

- **enforcing-evidence-based-analysis**: Did you READ the input files?
- **verifying-before-completion**: Did you RUN the output verification?

Both required. Neither substitutes for the other.

## Integration with writing-plans

**Evidence-based planning enhances plan quality:**

```markdown
## Before Writing Plan

1. Use enforcing-evidence-based-analysis to discover APIs
2. Document all APIs with source quotes
3. Create "Verified APIs" section in plan

## During Planning

- Reference verified APIs section
- Show "Actual API" vs "My Usage" for each
- Include assumptions section at end

## Plan Structure

# Implementation Plan: Feature X

## Prerequisites

- [ ] Read all relevant source files
- [ ] Documented verified APIs (see below)

## Verified APIs

### API 1: useWizard

**Source:** useWizard.ts (lines 72-77)
... [quote actual code]

### API 2: WizardStep

**Source:** types.ts (lines 15-22)
... [quote actual code]

## Implementation Tasks

Task 1: Use verified APIs
[Reference the verified APIs section]

## Assumptions

[List anything NOT verified]
```

## Integration with developing-with-tdd

**Evidence-based planning in RED phase:**

```markdown
## TDD Cycle with Evidence

### RED Phase

1. Write test first
2. **Verify test uses actual APIs** (enforcing-evidence-based-analysis)
3. Run test, confirm failure

### GREEN Phase

1. Implement minimal code
2. **Verify code uses actual APIs** (enforcing-evidence-based-analysis)
3. Run test, confirm pass
4. **Verify tests pass** (verifying-before-completion)

### REFACTOR Phase

1. Improve code
2. **Verify refactored code uses actual APIs** (enforcing-evidence-based-analysis)
3. Re-run tests
4. **Verify tests still pass** (verifying-before-completion)
```

## Integration with debugging-systematically

**Evidence-based planning when debugging:**

```markdown
## Debugging Workflow

### Hypothesis Generation

1. "I think the bug is in function X"
2. **READ function X source** (enforcing-evidence-based-analysis)
3. Quote actual implementation
4. Generate hypothesis based on ACTUAL code, not assumptions
5. It is still a HYPOTHESIS — reading X cannot confirm X is responsible

### Behavior Verification (textual)

1. "The code calls API Y"
2. **READ API Y implementation** (enforcing-evidence-based-analysis)
3. Quote actual behavior
4. Verify assumption about API was correct

This establishes what the code DOES. It does not establish that it is the CAUSE
— that is a separate class of claim, see [Textual vs. Causal Claims](causal-claims.md).

### Root Cause Confirmation (causal)

1. State the candidate cause as `HYPOTHESIS` with its textual evidence
2. **Name the instrument** that would confirm or kill it (profile, timing, log, bisect)
3. **Run it** — a measurement artifact, not another read
4. **Only if the instrument confirmed the cause you named** — not merely where the failure
   surfaced — drop the label and call it the root cause. A trace that locates a panic has
   confirmed the proximate event; if your claim reaches past it to an upstream producer, that
   part is still a hypothesis. If the instrument killed the candidate, say so and go back to
   step 1 — a run that disproved your hypothesis is a result, not a formality to pass through

Steps 1–4 of *Behavior Verification* never reach this section on their own. If you
cannot run step 3, the claim ships labelled.

### Fix Validation

1. Implement fix
2. Run tests (verifying-before-completion)
3. **Reproducer fails before the fix and passes after** — record both runs. A test that
   was never seen to fail may not exercise the defect at all, so "it passes" alone is not
   evidence the behavior changed
4. **For a cost, latency, or precedence claim, re-take the original measurement** — a
   fail-before/pass-after reproducer settles a functional defect, but it does not show
   that the thing you named is what dominated the cost
```

## Integration with researching-skills

**Evidence-based planning IS research:**

When `researching-skills` skill guides content population:

1. Find relevant files
2. **Read them with enforcing-evidence-based-analysis protocol**
3. Quote actual code
4. Document verified APIs
5. Populate skill content with real examples

## When Evidence-Based Planning Applies

| Activity                     | Applies? | Why                                         |
| ---------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Creating implementation plan | ✅ Yes   | Plans reference code/APIs                   |
| Writing code                 | ✅ Yes   | Code uses existing APIs                     |
| Debugging                    | ✅ Yes   | Understanding actual behavior               |
| Code review                  | ✅ Yes   | Reviewing actual implementation             |
| Architecture analysis        | ✅ Yes   | Documenting how system works                |
| User questions               | ❌ No    | Not making claims about code                |
| Running commands             | ❌ No    | verifying-before-completion applies instead |

## Workflow Example: Complete Feature

```markdown
## Feature: Add New Wizard Step

### Phase 1: Research (enforcing-evidence-based-analysis)

- Read existing wizard implementation
- Quote WizardStep interface
- Quote useWizard hook API
- Document verified APIs

### Phase 2: Plan (writing-plans + enforcing-evidence-based-analysis)

- Create implementation plan
- Reference verified APIs
- Show "Actual vs Proposed" for changes
- List assumptions

### Phase 3: TDD (developing-with-tdd + enforcing-evidence-based-analysis)

- Write test using verified APIs
- Implement using verified APIs
- Refactor preserving API contracts

### Phase 4: Verify (verifying-before-completion)

- Run tests: confirm pass
- Run linter: confirm clean
- Manual test: confirm works

### Phase 5: Review

- Code review uses verified API knowledge
- Reviewer confirms APIs match implementation
```

## The Bottom Line

**Evidence-based planning is the INPUT verification step.**

It pairs with verifying-before-completion (OUTPUT verification) to create complete confidence:

- Evidence-based inputs (verified)
- - Correct implementation (tested)
- - Verified outputs (confirmed)
- = High confidence in correctness
